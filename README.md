# Citbike Rental Overview Report
Dataset taken from Google's public bigQuery with table ID `bigquery-public-data:new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`.

## Overview
Citi Bike is NYCâ€™s official bike share program, designed to give residents and visitors a fun, affordable and convenient alternative to walking, taxis, buses and subways. 

Using the data from 2015 - 2016 we're analyzing the data to look for: 
1. Total trip
2. Average trip duration
3. Average bike trip per day
4. Average bike numbers used daily
5. Top start station
6. Top bikes used
7. Daily trend
8. Trip duration from user's gender
9. Most used bikes

## Result
Tools : SQL query using google BigQuery, Data visualizaton using Looker Studio (GDS). 

Firstly, let's take a look at the overall analysis.

- Overall Analysis

To answer previous questions : 
1. Total trip made is over 3 million trips over a year (2015 - 2016)
2. Average trip duration is 979 seconds or around 27 minutes per trip. 
3. Average bike trip per day is over 30,000 trips a day.
4. Average bike numbers used daily is over 4,500 bikes everyday.

We also put that the furthest trip made in the year is over 8 km while the average trip people made is around 1,8 km.

With the number of bike used increased every year, we can safely assume that so far in until 2016, the citibike business is thriving. More people used bike every year.
From average trip duration per month in the year 2015 to 2016, we can see there are ups and downs. Especially in October to March, there are less people using the bike probably due the weather since it's winter and too cold to bike. 
The same can be said on June where the number also decreased, probably due weather. It is possible in June they had common rain, or even storm which made them impossible to ride.

- Favorite Biking Day

We can see from the chart, that user most likely biking on Wednesday or Thursday over the weekends. This probably because more user having other events or even just staying at home resting on weekends. This means that citibike needs to prepare for a lot of bike stock ready to use during the time. 

- Customer Segmentation

We breakdown our user to their gender, but since it is not mandatory to fill when registering, there are a lot of "unknown" user. 
From gender, we can also see that male user ride faster than female users, probably because they like to speed up during biking due to their bigger physique. 

But what's with the unknown user? Why do they have longer duration? 
This probably because most of them aren't New Yorkers, could be visitors from other cities, travellers, or might be New Yorkers that just registering to try the bike and not coming back to use the application hence they took their time in biking, sightseeing, and having longer duration as the result. 

- User Age

From user age, we can see how the most users registered are 59 - 80 years old. Which in their age group, they probably have more time to try ew things like hoing biking, sightseeing, or it might be just their hobby. But the interesting thing to point out is, from trips by age group we can observe how this age group has less biking duration compared to the age group in 24 - 38. 
We can assume that, while the younger age group (24 - 38) bike longer since they have better physique, probably they travel to further distance and all, the oldest age group (59 - 80) only bike to closer stations, or use it just 1 -2 times for trying them out. 


- User Type

Comparing Subscriber with Customers, we can see how most users prefers to be Subscriber. This probably because being a subscribe member has better benefit, time efficient and cheaper compared to being a customer that has to re-registering when they have to use the service again. 

It also safe to assume that most customer are probably not a new yorker, or user that just trying out the service. Seeing from their bike duration, probably they bike slowly to sightseeing.
